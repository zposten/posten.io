## A long time ago in a galaxy...not too far from here
I got my start in development by taking the only programming course that my high school had to offer, Visual Basic.  I took an instant liking to it because of how logical it was; `if` this `then` that.  It made sense.  It reminded me of mathematics, another subject close to my heart.  Somehow that course, taken off-handedly in my junior year, ended up having the single greatest impact on my life of any class I took in my 12 years of public education.

## The next step
After some deliberating in my senior year of high school, I decided spend the next four years of my life at Milwaukee School of Engineering.  I chose it because of its clear emphasis on engineering, acclaimed Software Engineering program, and the fact that it was still in my home state of Wisconsin.  

Part of me wishes that I would have set my sights a little higher, wishes that I would have at least considered applying to a Carnegie Mellon, Caltech, or an MIT.  But the thought really didn't cross my mind at the time.  After going through the four years that I did however, and meeting the wonderful people that I did, if I had to do it again, I think I would make the same choice.

Prepare yourself, because I'm about to say something that you may well never hear (ok fine, read...you got me) another MSOE student/grad say again: I wasn't the smartest person there.  I have a theory about the students at MSOE, it always seemed to me that 99% of the students there think that they're smarter than 100% of the students there.  The university tends to attract students of a certain nature, and that is one of the unintended side effects.  I struggled in my Freshman year there.  I was trying to catch up to the majority of students who had significantly more programming experience than I did.  Thankfully, I got help from some particularly philanthropic individuals, and managed to pull my way through.  It got easier though.  Once I caught up to the curve, I started to push past it and in time was able to give back some of the help that I initially received.
