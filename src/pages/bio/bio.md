## A long time ago in a galaxy...not too far from here
I got my start in development by taking the only programming course that my high school had to offer, Visual Basic.  I took an instant liking to it because of how logical it was; `if` this `then` that.  It made sense.  It reminded me of mathematics, another subject close to my heart.  Somehow that course, taken off-handedly in my junior year, ended up having the single greatest impact on my life of any class I took in my 12 years of public education.

## The next step
After some deliberating in my senior year of high school, I decided spend the next four years of my life at Milwaukee School of Engineering.  I chose it because of its clear emphasis on engineering, acclaimed Software Engineering program, and the fact that it was still in my home state of Wisconsin.  

Part of me wishes that I would have set my sights a little higher, wishes that I would have at least considered applying to a Carnegie Mellon, Caltech, or an MIT.  But the thought really didn't cross my mind at the time.  After going through the four years that I did however, and meeting the wonderful people that I did, if I had to do it again, I think I would make the same choice.

Prepare yourself, because I'm about to say something that you may well never hear (ok fine, read...you got me) another MSOE student/grad say again: I wasn't the smartest person there.  I have a theory about the students at MSOE, it always seemed to me that 99% of the students there think that they're smarter than 100% of the students there.  The university tends to attract students of a certain nature, and that is one of the unintended side effects.  I struggled in my Freshman year there.  I was trying to catch up to the majority of students who had significantly more programming experience than I did.  Thankfully, I got help from some particularly philanthropic individuals, and managed to pull my way through.  It got easier though.  Once I caught up to the curve, I started to push past it and in time was able to give back some of the help that I initially received.


## Internship
I was lucky enough to get an internship at Johnson Controls late in my freshman year.  As fate would have it, I would work there consecutively from that time through my graduation and beyond.  The guy who was originally my mentor would eventually become my boss when he convinced me to come on full time.

I started at Johnson on the test team for the Mobile Access Portal (MAP) Gateway; an embedded linux device that emitted a wifi hotspot and plugged into a piece of smart equipment.  The user could then use their phone to connect to the hotspot and configure the equipment.  I wrote automated selenium scripts in python to test the web portal of the MAP.  This project taught me the importance of thorough test cases, the long term benefits of automated testing, and how to think like a software tester instead of a software developer.

Although I believe it was beneficial, I never enjoyed being a software tester.  I always felt as though my ability to create and solve problems was severely hampered.  Because I had expressed interest in moving into development, I was given the task of taking a relatively small tool that had been in the field for several years, and enhancing it.  A revamped UI and additional functionality was requested.  This project ended up becoming my Software Development Laboratory project during junior year as well, which was very convenient for me.  MSOE even published [an article][sdl-article] about it on their home page.  I have quoted that article in full [here][sdl-article-copy] in case it ever disappears.

After my work on that tool was complete, I made the logical next step to the JCI tools team.  This is the team that continually maintains and enhances the all important applications that allow tech's in the field to create and customize apps for Johnson building automation controllers; namely CCT and SCT.  As you might imagine, these tools are quite complex and are comprised of enormous, continually expanding code bases.  My main contribution to both CCT and SCT was a new feature for fast and efficient searching of large lists of enumerated values, dubbed the "Enum Finder".  


## Senior Design
If I'm being honest, I didn't learn a lot about software from senior design.  I did however, get more than my fair share of experience in dealing with people.  

When choosing groups for senior design at the end of junior year, I was in a bit of an unusual situation.  Relatively few of my close friends were SE's, and so once it became apparent that a cross discipline project wasn't going to come to fruition, I was in need of a group.  I was eventually recruited by a group that consisted partially of friends, and partially of friends-of-friends.  

One of the members of this group, gave me a particularly hard time throughout the nine months that we were in a group together.  We both had confrontational personalities, and were both very good engineers; of this I don't think anyone would dispute.  The problem was that we had very different ways of doing things, and each were extraordinarily confident that our way was right.  

Of the five of us in the group, we had a lot of different personality traits:
  - 3 confrontational personalities
  - 2 who preferred to avoid conflict
  - 2 who were very forthright with their opinions, regardless of the effect those opinions had on others
  - 1 who over-asserted the importance of process, much to the annoyance of his team
  - 2 who never did anything on time
  - 1 who got very stressed out when things weren't getting done
  - 4 who felt themselves best suited to present the project to others
  - 1 who felt strongly that he needed to lead the team
  - 2 who felt strongly that that individual _shouldn't_ lead the team
  - 1 who tended to overstate the work that he was doing
  - 2 who refused to disagree with each other
  - 2 who too often tried to force their opinions on their teammates
  - 2 who thought they had some talent at graphic design
  - 2 who thought that the other had no talent with graphic design

Hopefully you can begin to see how the combination of personalities made for an...interesting nine months.  It was a learning experience that I think I gained a lot from.  I would have to put those very skills to use far earlier in my career than I had hoped.

## Career
As graduation loomed, I had a big decision to make.  At which company was I going to start my career?  The simple choice was JCI.  I had worked there three years already, liked the people I've worked with, and had at least two different teams that wanted me to join them.

But the worry was present in the back of my mind, that I didn't want to orient myself so that I could _only_ work at Johnson.  I knew that a lot of my peers had moved around with their internships to several different companies while in school, whereas I had stayed in one place.  I also wanted to experience what it was like to work at a smaller business, where there wasn't 10 layers between me and the CEO. A place where nerf gun turrets monitored the halls and company wide celebrations were orchestrated.  

I had a very successful first attendance to the MSOE career fair, and scheduled interviews with six different companies.  Somehow though, none of the six met my description.  I ended up in a decision between SafeNet, and JCI.  SafeNet is a high quality contracting company that was recommended to me by two SafeNet employees who were contracting on the MAP team at Johnson.  The problem was though, that SafeNet's largest customer is none other than Johnson Controls.  So had I accepted that position, I could have very well ended up back at Johnson anyway.  For that and a few other reasons, I decided that my career would start the same way my internship did, with Johnson Controls.
