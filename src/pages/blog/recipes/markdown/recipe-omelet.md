My mom's omelets are famous where I come from, and for good reason.  It was difficult getting her to give me measurements that didn't consist of "pinches" and "splashes" of things, but eventually I got pretty close.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient                  | Amount                                                               |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bacon                       | 1 lb                                                                 |
| Potatoes                    | 2 small per omelet                                                   |
| Vegetable oil               | Most of a bottle                                                     |
| Eggs                        | 2 per omelet                                                         |
| Milk                        | 1/8 cup per omelet                                                     |
| Shredded cheddar cheese     | Enough to coat the entirety of each omelet (will differ by pan size) |
| Salt and pepper             | To taste                                                             |
| Yellow onion (optional)     | 1                                                                    |
| Sausage (optional)          | To taste                                                             |

## Prep

### Bacon
- [ ] Cook bacon, save grease
- [ ] Break up into small pieces

### Potatoes
- [ ] Peel potatoes
- [ ] Dice into small cubes (or you know, rectangular prisms).
- [ ] Pour vegetable oil into a large frying pan until it's filled to a quarter of its depth.
    - Too much oil can cause it to overflow when potatoes are added because of the large amount of sizzle
- [ ] Heat on high until potatoes sizzle when placed in.
    - Oil should be hot enough so that the outside gets crispy while the inside does not.  The burner should be at least as high as 8/10.  
    - Be very careful of splatter when pouring the potatoes into the hot oil. I would suggest using a spoon to drop them in a small amount at a time.  Try not to splash the oil, it's _realllly_ hot.
    - If at any time grease starts to overflow the pan, immediately remove it from heat
    - It's sometimes easier to cook the potatoes in batches rather than all at once, to ensure that the pan doesn't overflow.
- [ ] Let sit for two minutes (stir too early and the potatoes will turn to mush).
- [ ] Stir until potato cuboids are golden brown.
- [ ] Place the potatoes in a large bowl lined with paper towel to soak up grease

### Eggs
- [ ] 2 eggs/omelet
- [ ] Add a quarter cup of milk for every four eggs
- [ ] Add about a shake of each salt and pepper per egg for flavoring
- [ ] Whisk the mixture until it's a cohesive whole.


## Make It

- [ ] Coat the bottom of the pan in bacon oil by tipping the pan around
- [ ] Pour the eggs into the pan to fill the bottom in a quick fashion so part of it doesn't start to cook before the rest
- [ ] Let the egg solidify while filling any holes
- [ ] Add cheese over the entirety of the egg
- [ ] Add the potatoes, bacon and optionally the onion and sausage on half of the egg circle
- [ ] When the egg has some brown on the bottom, carefully flip the other half of egg over the ingredient half
	- It may be helpful to use two spatulas to do this.
