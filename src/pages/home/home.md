For those of you who don't know me, my name is Zach. For those of you who do know me, my name is still Zach.  In May of 2016, I graduated from [MSOE][msoe] with high honors with a Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering, and a minor in Mathematics.  My degree is in Software Engineering, but at my core I am a problem solver. I love puzzles in all forms, and an constantly looking for new challenges.

For three of my four years in college and since graduation, I have been working at Johnson Controls.  My first role at JCI while I was an intern was in software testing.  I wrote automated [Selenium][selenium] scripts in Python to validate the functionality of a web application.  After that I moved on to a development position, renovating an old Windows Forms app.  From there, I started to work with the JCI tools team on two very large Java applications that interact with Johnson HVAC controllers; CCT and SCT.  Most recently, I've been working on a super secret UWP project.
